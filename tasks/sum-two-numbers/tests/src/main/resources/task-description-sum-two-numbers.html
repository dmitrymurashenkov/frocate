<p><h1>Tutorial task - sum two numbers</h1>


<h3 class="heading-h3-blue" id="description">Description</h3>

<p>
    This tutorial task will teach you basics of solving Frocate tasks. We will build simple HTTP
    service that accepts requests with two numbers and returns their sum in response.

    <b>This tutorial is not yet in final version, we are going to add some examples</b><br>
    Alright, so let's right down what we need to do:
    <ul>
        <li>
            First of all we need write the calculation code - one that accepts two numbers and returns it's sum.
            It should be able to handle very large numbers. Basic math facilities in many languages can only handle
            numbers up to 8 bytes long, but there is almost always some library that can help us with that.
        </li>
        <li>
            Then we need to test it - don't rely on Frocate tests to get all your errors. Usually it is faster to
            write some unit tests before you try to submit your solution for the first time.
        </li>
        <li>
            Next we need to write HTTP handling code - we may either do all low-level stuff ourselves - bind server TCP
            socket, accept request and parse it as string, extracting arguments to sum. Or you can find some library
            that provides fully-functional HTTP server. The choice is up to you, but we think that using external
            library can actually save you a lot of time.
        </li>
        <li>
            When using 3rd party library the tricky part is that we should start HTTP server from our app using its API.
            This is unsual approach and not all HTTP servers can be used like that so choose wisely. Google something
            like "embedded http server" for the language of your choice.
        </li>
        <li>
            Next we need to make our app accept some configuration at startup - what port to bind to, for example. Config
            is provided via text file. Path to it is passed as an argument to your application during startup: "./myapp /etc/myapp/config.txt".
            Config consists of simple "property=value" lines. Each task provides different set of properties so please
            refer to <a onclick="$('#environment-content').showAndScrollTo();" href="#">environment</a> section for details.
        </li>
        <li>
            Once you've managed to accept some http requests and provide more or less correct responses it is time to
            build everything into single file and submit it for evaluation. In most languages initially libraries come
            as a separate files that are added to project, often after app is built libraries still reside in separate
            files, but we need to build whole app into single file, packing all libraries inside it. For C-like languages
            this is called "static linking", for java "jar with dependencies" or "uber jar" and such packaging is used
            more often than one might think.
        </li>
        <li>
            Once your app is built - submit it and wait for results. Evaluation process is simple - we start your app
            providing config, run some tests against it and show you the results. Tests invoke API and check results.
            Tests stop after first error. Each test has some configured timeout, for simple tests which perform single
            API call this is usually about 3 seconds, for load tests that make thousands of calls this is something like
            30-60 seconds so be patient.
        </li>
        <li>
            Once tests have finished - check if they all passed. You are likely to encounter errors during at first, so
            let's get to debugging. Not much of a help here - you are given logs of test process and your process. "Logs"
            are simply all stdout output dumped to file so if you are using some logging framework in your app then
            configure it to output all messages to stdout.
        </li>
        <li>
            If nothing helps - post a comment with your problem. Frocate is currently in alpha version, so there must be
            tons of errors both in tests and infrastructure, but with your help we will fix them :)
