<p><h1>Task - money tranfer</h1>


<h3 class="heading-h3-blue" id="description">Description</h3>


<p>
    We have a banking system backend that holds accounts and their balances. Its architect read too much
    about microservices and decided that it was a "good" idea to split the system in two modules:
    "Balance service" that only stores accounts balance and provides internal API to modify balance of
    specified account by certain amount and the "Transfer service" that provides actual usable API to
    transfer money from one account to another without risk of losing them in process.
</p>
<p>
    As if this wasn't enough this particular system features a rather "unique" definition of rollback case,
    that has to be handled, but more about that later :)
</p>
<p>
    The easy part was done and Balance service was implemented, but now nobody is willing to take on the
    Transfer service development. And here is where you come in!
</p>

<div style="text-align: center">

</div>

<h3>What needs to be done</h3>

<p>
    Develop an app that provides HTTP API conforming to <a onclick="$('#transfer-service-content').showAndScrollTo();" href="#">Transfer service requirements</a>, build it into single
    file (see <a href="/supported-exec-types.jsp">supported executable file types</a>) and submit it. We will start Balance service, Frontend and your
    service, run some integration tests and tell you if it actually works and how well you app performed!
</p>

<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-blue">
    Yes, you actually have to bind the socket and listen for incoming HTTP requests! This is not a drill :)
</div>


<h3 class="heading-h3-blue" id="terms">Terms and definitions</h3>


<ul>
    <li><b>Account</b> - holds some amount of money, managed by Balance service, has following properties</li>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Id</b> - unique identifier of the account, string value, consists of chars "a-zA-Z0-9", max length 50 chars</li>
        <li><b>Balance</b> - actual amount of money in $, integer value</li>
    </ul>
    <li><b>Debit operation</b> - (or simply - operation) changes balance of single account by specified amount, performed via Balance service API, if the amount is negative then can be referred to as the "credit operation"</li>
    <li><b>Transaction</b> - group of debit operations that must be either all completed or rolled back, performed via Transfer service API. Transaction has an id and consists of several transfers</li>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Id</b> - unique identifier of the transaction, string value, consists of chars "a-zA-Z0-9", max length 50 chars</li>
        <li><b>Transfer</b> - a pair of debit/credit operations, like "transfer 10$ from account 1 to account 2" (credit account 1 by 10$ and debit account 2 by 10$)</li>
    </ul>
</ul>

<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-blue">
    Note that transactions here are not ACID. There are merely groups of operations that should eventually
    either all complete or be rolled back.

    The task is to provide HTTP API:<br><br>

    <div class="well">
        GET /transaction?txId=1&transfer=account1,account2,10&transfer=account3,account4,15
    </div>

    <p>Single GET request means single transaction.</p>
    <p>
        This particular example means: perform transaction with id "1" with 2 transfers - transfer 10$ from
        account1 to account2 and 15$ from account3 to account4. So we need to perform 4 operations: credit
        account1 by 10$, debit account2 by 10$, credit account3 by 15$ and debit account4 by 15$.
    </p>


    <p><b>Params:</b></p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>txId</b> - transaction id to pass to Balance service</li>
        <li><b>transfer</b> - single triplet of comma-separated values "from,to,amount", there may be several such
            params in url meaning that several transfers within a single transaction must be performed</li>
        <ul>
            <li><b>From</b> - string value</li>
            <li><b>To</b> - string value</li>
            <li><b>Amount</b> - positive integer value</li>
