Source of [frocate.com](http://frocate.com) - pragmatic programming tasks platform

Frocate is a platform with programming tasks. It tries to be different from others by 
focusing on real life task solving environment - use any 3rd party libraries you want,
google whatever you want - just provide the solution.

Since sometimes it is difficult to debug your solution when it is run on remote host
and you only can view logs - we provide full source of tests here. Perhaps it will
help on your path to knowledge.

Good luck and have fun solving tasks!
